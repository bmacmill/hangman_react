# Hangman type game with react


what I learned
-make paragraph a max width if you want it to wrap
-margin top and bottom use margin-block: XXpx;

-using the npm package clsx to render complex/compund class names
-making derived state out of existing state for keyboard component, much easier than making 2 more state instances!
