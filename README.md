# Hangman type game with react


what I learned
-make paragraph a max width if you want it to wrap
-margin top and bottom use margin-block: XXpx;
-lifting state up when necessary; heard mentioned many times but never had to do it. it's a little confusing but nothing to be 'scared' about!
-using the npm package clsx to render complex/compund class names
-making derived state out of existing state for keyboard component, much easier than making 2 more state instances!
-nested ternary as in the status component, it's ugly but works.
-helper function using if/else statement so you can return something in status component
